=>PRIVILEGES OR DCL (Data Control Language):

	When multiple users can access database objects, authorisation can be controlled to these objects with privileges. Every object has an owner.


	There are 2 types of Privileges:
			->System Privileges:
					->Alter Any Index
					->Alter any Sequence
					->Alter any Table
					->Alter any View
					->Create any Index
					->Create any Sequence
					->Create any Table
					->Create any View
			->Object Privileges

	=>There must be one root user / sysdba (system administrator) which gives permissions to other users.


		->Grant Keyword:
				Used to give privileges to users.
		->Revoke:
				Used to revoke the granted privileges.

		Syntax:
System Privilege: ALL DDL COMMANDS
			GRANT sys_privileges (available system privileges you want to give) to {username | Public | role_name} [WITH ADMIN]
		With Admin means this user can give the privileges given to it to other users as well....
		SELECT ANY TABLE
Object Privilege: ALL DML COMMANDS
			->DELETE
			->INDEX
			->INSERT
			->REFERENCES
			->SELECT
			->UPDATE
		Can Grant privileges to certain objects only...
		GRANT privilege_name ON object_name TO {user_name |PUBLIC |role_name} [WITH GRANT OPTION];
Process:
		sys as sysdba
		CREATE USER username IDENTIFIED BY password;
		CONNECT username / password   => Connects the database to another existing user.
		GRANT CREATE SESSION TO username; -> Is a must for the user to log in to database
		Grant SELECT ANY TABLE to username;
		GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE to username;
		CONNECT username/password;
		
->Practice Questions:
		1. Create a database user with your name and password as your roll number.
			-- First login to the admin account
			CREATE USER agharbab IDENTIFIED BY blueBoy
		2. Grant all system privileges to the user such that he can pass those privileges on.
			GRANT ALTER ANY INDEX, ALTER ANY SEQUENCE, CREATE TABLE,... TO agharbab WITH ADMIN OPTION;
			GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO agharbab;
			GRANT CREATE SESSION TO agharbab
		3. Use the user account to display the details of all employees in the databse.
			-- Login to the User Account // CONNECT username/password
			CONNECT agharbab/blueBoy;
			SELECT * FROM emp;

Important Tasks: (Included in Exam
		1. Find the difference between a user and role
 		2. If a column in the where condition is being used as foreign key in another table and a relationship of referential integrity exists then row from such a table can't be deleted. 


	->Create a User and Assign object and system privileges.
	/as sysdba 			-- Admin Login
	CREATE USER talha IDENTIFIED by moulana;
	GRANT SELECT ANY TABLE TO talha; / GRANT SELECT ON emp TO talha
	CONNECT scott/tiger 		-- Supposing scott already exists
	GRANT SELECT/INSERT		-- Wrong Query => Missing the [to username] part.
	CONNECT talha/moulana
	SELECT *  FROM emp;
